And this should really go into the .RAD file. It is kind of stream of conciousness.

So I built it up from scratch and skipped a fair amount of .git jive. I set up the µ.xcdm and then the abstract controllers and even the test for these BUT I did not set up the concrete controller. I added code coverage from ~12 to 40 percent. 

Next I set up the root entity and the tests for all of the DataControllers kind of closing the loop on testing. With the funny bit being that I am still on the teplate version of the .µ, so that I am at a fairly high coverage even before I make the first object in the runtime. As a matter of fact I wend through dozens of MILLIONS of passes of my randomizers to get it nice and tidy. But the best part of it is I haven't even made the interface. I mean I have several. Heck one of the design goal is to make it cross platform, So I can add another project. 
The TableViewController only needs an array not a complete MOC, IIRC that is what is in the template.µ so All I really need to do is square it off and close the testing loop then drop all of the jive template out of the GUI and roll. I keep
