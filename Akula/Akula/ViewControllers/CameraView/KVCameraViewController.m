/**
Okay
 the first time around It took the object
 Second Time Just the photo
 This time around it will be a more complete implementation of the first one with an object and a MOC or Some controller AAMOF it could be done in protocols for what it is worth
AND Speaking on Protocols what does a camera contoller actually do in Cocoa? I mean before I go re-inventing the wheel and junk. I mean I can reverse the Swift Implementation that I have in Tricorder with an MVP in this the CurrentBuild v.16
 AND ALSO  since it is loading the view nil, am I really wired up in the XIB?(yup) then I would prefer to fix the AppDelegate level issues first
