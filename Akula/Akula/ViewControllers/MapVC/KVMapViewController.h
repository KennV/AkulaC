 Currently these will be optional
 I STRONGLY SUSPECT that I will be implementing these in the actual controller for person; Or that somehow, and likely quite obvious; I will be a delegate of a delegate in this
 _Theory-WIse_ what it is, is that I have all of the basic db-like functions {actual or swift-proto's} but that is not what the application is. It is the actual behavior of these things. AND I certainly do not want to be doing these here. Rather I should be hitting them off in the ClassController [20180619@1100]
